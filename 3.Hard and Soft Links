A link in UNIX is a pointer to a file.  Creating links is a kind of shortcuts to access a file. Links allow more than one file name to refer to the same file, elsewhere. 

There are two types of links :

1) Hard Links

2) Sift Links


soft link is an actual link to the original file, 
whereas a hard link is a mirror copy of the original file. 
If you delete the original file, the soft link has no value, because it points to a non-existent file.

1) Hard links:

 creating a hard link:  $ ln file.txt hardlink.txt

2) Soft Links :

  Command to create a soft link:  $ ln -s file.txt softlink.txt
  
  soft link is an actual link to the original file, whereas a hard link is a mirror copy of the original file. If you delete the original file, the soft link has no value, because it points to a non-existent file.
