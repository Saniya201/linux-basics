Introduction:
In Linux, 
users must structure storage devices (USB and hard drives) before using them. Partitioning is also useful when you are installing multiple operating systems on a single machine


Two types of partitions :

		1) Primary Partition : this partition contains the booting files.

		2) Extended Partition : this partition contains the storage files for other data to store.

There are two main types of partition tables: MBR and GPT.

MBR :

	MBR is a special boot sector located at the beginning of a drive. This sector contains a boot loader for the installed operating system and 

	information about the drive’s logical partitions. The boot loader is a small bit of code that generally loads the larger boot loader from another partition on a drive.

	MBR does have its limitations. For starters, MBR only works with disks up to 2 TB in size. MBR also only supports up to four primary partitions—

	if you want more, you have to make one of your primary partitions an “extended partition” and create logical partitions inside it. MBR have maximum 26 partitions.

	MBR had no way of knowing if its data was corrupted—you’d only see there was a problem when the boot process failed or your drive’s partitions vanished.

GPT :

	GPT is called as GUID Partition Table because every partition on your drive has a “globally unique identifier,” or GUID—

	a random string so long that every GPT partition on earth likely has its own unique identifier.

	GPT doesn’t suffer from MBR’s limits. GPT-based drives can be much larger, with size limits dependent on the operating system and

	its file systems. GPT also allows for a nearly unlimited number of partitions. Maximun size for this is nearly 10TB and it have maximun 126 partitions.

	On an MBR disk, the partitioning and boot data is stored in one place. If this data is overwritten or corrupted, you’re in trouble. 

	In contrast, GPT stores multiple copies of this data across the disk, so it’s much more robust and can recover if the data is corrupted.

	GPT also stores cyclic redundancy check (CRC) values to check that its data is intact. If the data is corrupted, GPT can notice the problem . 

	
Steps to create a partitons:

  1. List of partitions                      -> parted -l

  2. Lable a partitions                      -> parted/dev/vdb mklabel msdos

  3. Use mkpart to make a partiton           -> parted/dev/vdb -> p mkpart ->primary-> xfs->2048s ->1000MB ->p ->quit                                                                                                                 

  4. Let the partition be created/setteled   -> udevadm settle

  5. Attach the file system to the partition -> mkfs.xfs/dev/vdb

  6. Create a mount point directory          -> df -h ->mkdir /archive

  7. Add entry in fstab                      -> cat/etc/fstab -> lsblk/dev/vdb -> lsblk --fs/dev/vdb -> vi/etc/fstab

  8. System daeman - reload                  -> mount/archive/ ->df -h ->cd/archive/ ->ls ->touch file.txt ->ls -> history

  9. Mount the partition on the directory

  10. Reboot
	

	
Commands :

- list block with UUID :- Lsblk --fs /dev/vdb

- list partitions :- parted -l

- make label to a partition :- parted /dev/vdb mklabel msdos

- create a partition :- mkpart

- wait till partition is registered successfully :- udevadm settle

- format file system with XFS file system :- mkfs.xfs /dev/vdb1

- restart daemon service :- systemctl daemon-reload
