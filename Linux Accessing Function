Linux accessing function:

Although there are already a lot of good security features built into Linux-based systems,
one very important potential vulnerability can exist when local access is granted that is file permission based issues resulting from a user not assigning the correct permissions to files and directories.


Permission Types:

Each file or directory has three basic permission types:

read - The Read permission refers to a user's capability to read the contents of the file.

write - The Write permissions refer to a user's capability to write or modify a file or directory.

execute - The Execute permission affects a user's capability to execute a file or view the contents of a directory.

Viewing the Permissions

You can view the permissions by checking the file or directory permissions in your favorite GUI File Manager (which I will not cover here) or by reviewing the output of the \"ls -l\" command while in the terminal and while working in the directory which contains the file or folder.

The permission in the command line is displayed as: _rwxrwxrwx 1 owner:group

User rights/Permissions

The first character that I marked with an underscore is the special permission flag that can vary.

The following set of three characters (rwx) is for the owner permissions.

The second set of three characters (rwx) is for the Group permissions.

The third set of three characters (rwx) is for the All Users permissions.

Following that grouping since the integer/number displays the number of hardlinks to the file.

The last piece is the Owner and Group assignment formatted as Owner:Group.
