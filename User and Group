Linux is a multi-user operating system, 
which means that more than one user can use Linux at the same time.
Linux provides a beautiful mechanism to manage users in a system. 
One of the most important roles of a system administrator is to manage the users and groups in a system. 
All the commands used in this article are explained using the CentOS Linux distro.

There are two types of users – the root or super user and normal users. 
A root or super user can access all the files, while the normal user has limited access to files. 
A super user can add, delete and modify a user account.

Linux group is a mechanism to organise a collection of users.
Like the user ID, each group is also associated with a unique ID called the group ID. 
There are two types of groups

 – a primary group and a supplementary group. 
 Each user is a member of a primary group and of zero or ‘more than zero’ supplementary groups.
